# Pathways To Desistance

The Pathways to Desistance study is a multi-site, longitudinal study of serious adolescent offenders as they transition from adolescence into early adulthood. Between November, 2000 and January, 2003, 1,354 adjudicated youths from the juvenile and adult court systems in Maricopa County (Phoenix), Arizona (N = 654) and Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania (N = 700) were enrolled into the study (Mulvey, 2012). Because the Pathways to Desistance data is not public, it has not been added to this repository. 

For my Dean's Distinguished Fellowship project at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse, I analyzed the baseline interview dataset and investigated the question "how do co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders impact the frequency of criminal activity"? To establish co-occurrance, mental health disorders were described as having any symptoms of mental health disorders in their lifetime, given the young age of participants, and substance use disorders were described to be any alcohol or substance use within the past year. 

Along with investigating the impacts of mental health and substance use, further analysis was done to investigate the most impactful life factors. This investigation was to identify possible programs in the community that could decrease criminal activity. Providing communal support for young adults would decrease observed criminal activity and could decrease the number of adults entering the criminal justice system.
